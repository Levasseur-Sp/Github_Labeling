# Github Labeling

This is the result of wanting a less annoying labeling system for when I create a repo.

Could've created a gist but decided on making a repo as it gives an opportunity to test it and have a readme.

## Usage
- Clone this project `git clone https://github.com/Levasseur-Sp/Github_Labeling`
- Create a [personal github access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/)
  - Make a `.token` file
  - Copy the token given by github and put it inside the `.token` file
## Origin
- [github#371](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/371)
- [github#281](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/281)
- Cloned from [this one](https://gist.github.com/Chompas/fb158eb01204d03f783d)
  - The original is noted in the gist
